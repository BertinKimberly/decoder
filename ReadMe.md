# QR Code, Barcode, PDF417, Aztec, and MaxiCode Decoder

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based application designed to decode various types of codes including QR codes, Barcodes, PDF417, Aztec, and MaxiCode. Each code type has its dedicated folder, implementing specific technologies and libraries optimized for decoding that particular format.

```bash
project-root/
├── qr/
├── barcode/
├── pdf417/
├── aztec/
└── maxicode/
```

Each folder contains the relevant scripts, dependencies, and resources needed to decode that specific code type.

### Technologies Used

-  Python: The primary programming language used for this project.

-  Libraries: Depending on the code type, the following libraries are utilized:

`pyzbar` for QR Code decoding

`pyzbar` for Barcode decoding

`pdf417decoder` for PDF417 decoding

`pyztec.aztec` for Aztec code decoding

`zxing` for MaxiCode decoding

#### Features

-  Efficient decoding for multiple code formats

-  Modular structure for easy maintenance and updates

-  Support for various image input formats
